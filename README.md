# DefenderOfChristMenu
## STAR MY PROJECT IF YOU LIKED IT PLEASE
This is a discord menu I made, make sure to put your token in the config.json and it should work.
I have not added any commands so using the command prefix is useless as of now it only has the menu in the python script.
Options 4 and 6 are broken
